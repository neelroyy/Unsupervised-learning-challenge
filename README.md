# Unsupervised-learning-challenge

The task is to use clustering algorithms to explore whether myopia patients can be placed into distinct groups. This may be useful to analyze these groups of patients separately. 

# Results and Discussion

The groups or clusters are determined through (i) dimensionality reduction, applying PCA and t-SNE, and (ii) K-Means clustering. The visualizations are added in the "Visualizations" folder.

Based on the analyses, the optimal number of clusters can be 3 to 5.

Note: Columns with smaller values may not need to standardize together with other columns having larger values. This can be explored further. As the clustering visualizations look reasonable, different standardization optimizations are not explored.
